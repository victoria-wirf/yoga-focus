<p>The main objective of this website is to introduce yoga and meditation into people's daily lives since the benefits are many.
The website will introduce all the benefits in summarized text and encouragement to sign up for a newsletter where they will be provided with more information on yoga and meditation. 
The website will start by motivating the visitor to want to know more about yoga and meditation and how it can improve their overall health for example lower stress, reduce anxiety, improve sleep, etc.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<b>Navigation Bar</b>

The top of the website consists of a  responsive navigation bar where the logo is placed on the far left and the menu on the right. The logo was made with the help of Looka, a website that generates logos based on input about the brand such as color, sentiment, and branch. The menu bar consists of ”Home”, ”Inspiration” and ”Contact”, all of them being links for easy user navigation.
